<p>Are the Nashville Predators going to be able to compete with the rest of the National Hockey League or have they fallen to the bottom of the ranks? The Predators haven’t made much noise since their Stanley Cup final showing in the 2016-2017 season, but with the retirement of goalie Pekka Rinne this summer it brings a new challenge in the net for both their competitors and their own team.</p>

<p>For my first comparison, I’m going to look at Nashville’s offense and defense compared to the rest of the league through a scatter plot. The two sets of data that will be used are shooting percentage and save percentage. I want to see how the Predators compare to the rest of the league so far this season and get an idea of where they stand.</p>
<p>The data that I’ll be using are the overall league statistics for the 2021-2022 season that started in early October from Sports Reference’s hockey reference site.</p>
<p>The first thing that I’m going to do with the data is filter out the Nashville Predators so that I can compare them directly to the rest of the league.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nhl2122 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;C:/Users/Autumn/Desktop/spmc350/Blog/data/2122nhl.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 32 Columns: 32</code></pre>
<pre><code>## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot;
## chr  (1): Team
## dbl (31): Rk, AvAge, GP, W, L, OL, PTS, PTS%, GF, GA, SOW, SOL, SRS, SOS, GF...</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>nash &lt;- nhl2122 %&gt;% 
  filter(Team == &quot;Nashville Predators&quot;) </code></pre>
<p>My next step is to calculate the average shot percentage and save percentage for the NHL.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Average for the NHL
nhl2122 %&gt;% 
  summarise(
    avg_shots = mean(`S%`),
    avg_saves = mean(`SV%`)
  )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   avg_shots avg_saves
##       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      9.25     0.908</code></pre>
<p>Once I’ve figured out my averages, I can go ahead and start to put together my scatter plot. I’ve imputed both the NHL data and the Predators data so that they can be easily compared. I have also added the averages for both shot percentage and save percentage so that they cross on the chart and show where the leagues average is.</p>
<p>What I’m looking to see from the chart is where Nashville is placed in comparison to the rest of the leagues offense and defense skills.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = nhl2122, aes(x = `S%`, y = `SV%`), color = &#39;grey&#39;) +

    y = &quot;Save-%&quot;,
    x = &quot;Shooting-%&quot;,

<p>The data shows that Nashville falls dead center on the NHL average. One team does seem to be a clear winner with the best save percentage and shooting percentage, which is in the top right corner and that is the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Hurricanes look to have the best defense and offense, we’ll dig further into comparing the both the ’Canes and the Predators. In this next graphic, I’ll be using a waffle chart to compare the amount of power play opportunities that each team gets and how many goals they score while on a power play.</p>
<p>First I will create a vector of data for each teams statistics for power play goals scored and power play opportunities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>np &lt;- c(&quot;Power Play Goals&quot; = 7, &quot;Power Play Opportunities&quot; = 26)

ch &lt;- c(&quot;Power Play Goals&quot; = 8, &quot;Power Play Opportunities&quot; = 27)</code></pre>
<p>Then I will take those vectors and use them to iron together two waffle charts, one for each team. Each square in the waffle chart will be made to represent each chance that the teams will have had to be on a power play.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iron(
 waffle(np, rows = 3, title=&quot;Nashville&#39;s Power Play Usage&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square = 1 chance&quot;, colors = c(&quot;#011840&quot;, &quot;#FFB915&quot;)),
 waffle(ch, rows = 3, title=&quot;Carolina&#39;s Power Play Usage&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square = 1 chance&quot;, colors = c(&quot;#090909&quot;, &quot;#CF0820&quot;))
)</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://ahaebig2.github.io/2021/10/31/nashville-predators/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From the graphic, we can see that so far this season the Predators have had just one more chance to score on a power play than the Hurricanes have. Though they have had this extra opportunity they have struggled to use it and are currently one power play goal behind Carolina.</p>
<p>For this last chart, I’m going to look into the other positions on the ice and see which ones score the most points per game and how the Predators compare to the rest of the leagues scorers. To do so, I’ll need to bring in a new set of data that provides the name of the players, their positions, and how many points they have scored this season.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)</code></pre>
<p>First, I’m going to have to get rid of the players who have not scored any points this season so far. To do so I will have to filter out players who have scored more than zero points. Points include both goals scored and assists.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nhlplayers &lt;- read_csv(&quot;C:/Users/Autumn/Desktop/spmc350/Blog/data/nhlplayers.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## New names:
## * GC -&gt; GC...7
## * GC -&gt; GC...11</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 499 Columns: 13</code></pre>
<pre><code>## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot;
## chr  (3): Player, Tm, Pos
## dbl (10): Rk▲, Age, GP, GC...7, G, A, PTS, GC...11, PIM, S</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>activeplayers &lt;- nhlplayers %&gt;% filter(PTS &gt; 0)</code></pre>
<p>My next step is to create a data set for Nashville by filtering out those players that are including in the active players who have scored more than zero points. I have then placed them in descending order to view who on the team has scored the most points so far.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nash &lt;- activeplayers %&gt;% 
  filter(Tm == &quot;NSH&quot;) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(`PTS`))</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I will create my beeswarm plots by categorizing the players by their positions and then looking at how many points that player has scored. The Nashville Predators can be seen as the yellow points on the chart.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() + 
  geom_beeswarm(
    data=activeplayers, 
    groupOnX=TRUE, 
    aes(x=Pos, y=`PTS`), color=&quot;grey&quot;) + 
  geom_beeswarm(
    data=nash, 
    groupOnX=TRUE, 
    aes(x=Pos, y=`PTS`), color=&quot;#FFB915&quot;)+
  labs(
    y = &quot;Points Per Game&quot;,
    title = &quot;Nashville&#39;s Top Scorers are Centers and Defense&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;Nine Predators accumulate points but only three positions are scoring&quot;,
    caption = &quot;By: Autumn Haebig  |  Source: Sports Reference&quot;
  ) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://ahaebig2.github.io/2021/10/31/nashville-predators/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The data shows that the majority of scorers come from the centers, defense, and then the right and left wings. For Nashville, they only have nine players who have scored points and the majority of those players are centers and defense. The highest scorers in both the NHL and for the Predators are centers and Nashville seems to have a couple high scoring centers in the league. This chart also shows how Nashville is lacking wingers who can score points. The league seems to have a decent amount of left wing scorers but Nashville has none at the moment.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the Predators aren’t in a horrible position at the start of this season. There are improvements that can be made in the scoring department and in the defensive areas but Nashville seems to be just about middle of the rank in the NHL.</p>
