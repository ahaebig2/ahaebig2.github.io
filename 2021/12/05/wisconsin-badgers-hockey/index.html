<p>For this assignment, I want to look at the Wisconsin Badgers women’s hockey team for this season of 2021-2022. The Wisconsin women are known for being very competitive and a highly ranked national team. Originally I wanted to compare the women’s team to the men’s team at Wisconsin but instead I’m going to look at the women’s team compared to the another top team in their division and the NCAA, Ohio State. Looking at NCAA Statistics, the Badgers rank below Ohio State in scoring offense so I’m going to look into how the two teams compare. Looking at Wisconsin itself I want to see if the Badgers have better scorers than Ohio State. I also want to look at what position those scoring players play in. From there I want to see the top point scorer, including assists, to determine who the top MVP is for the Badgers right now in the season.</p>

<p>First, after looking at the NCAA statistics ranking of scoring offense you can see that Ohio State outranks Wisconsin. So to further look at the stats, I’m going to use the data from that ranking to create a waffle chart to look at the actual comparison of the teams.</p>
<p>The statistics that are used in looking at scoring offense are goals and average goals. They use these two data sets to reach what looks like a percentage.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>os &lt;- c(&quot;Goals&quot; = 16, &quot;Average Goals&quot; = 83)

wi &lt;- c(&quot;Goals&quot; = 16, &quot;Average Goals&quot; = 80, 3)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>iron(
 waffle(os, rows = 3, title=&quot;Ohio State&#39;s Scoring Offense&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square = 1 Goal&quot;, colors = c(&quot;#B0B7BC&quot;, &quot;#BB0000&quot;)),
 waffle(wi, rows = 3, title=&quot;Wisconsin&#39;s Scoring Offense&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square = 1 Goal&quot;, colors = c(&quot;#090909&quot;, &quot;#C5050C&quot;, &quot;white&quot;))
)</code></pre>

<p>In the waffle chart above you can see that Ohio State and Wisconsin don’t have that large of a difference. Both teams have the same amount of goals at 16 but in average goals the Buckeyes outscore Wisconsin by 3 so far this season. The scoring offense for Ohio State is 5.19 and the scoring offense for the Badgers is at 5.00. This shows that there isn’t much of a difference between the two teams but Wisconsin is lacking in the number of average goals scored in comparison to Ohio State.</p>
<p>In this next section, I’m looking at specific positions, players, and how many goals they score. The graphic below is a comparison of scorers from both the University of Wisconsin and the Ohio State University.</p>
<p>I first had to look and see how many Badgers are scoring goals and what position they play. The majority of scorers for Wisconsin are forwards. Casey O’Brien is the highest scorer with a total of 16 goals so far this season.</p>
<p>I also looked at Ohio State individually to see what positions have their highest scorers and how many goals they have scored. Overall, Ohio State has more people scoring goals with a total of 18 players in comparison to Wisconsin only have 13 players scoring. Ohio State also has double the amount of defenders scoring than the Badgers. One positive is that the highest scorer for the Buckeyes, Gabby Rosenthal, only has 12 goals so far this season. It’s safe to say that Wisconsin has a great scoring offender in O’Brien.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>scoring &lt;- Badgers %&gt;% 
  filter(Goals &gt;= 1) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(`Goals`))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>oscore &lt;- Ohio %&gt;%

  arrange(desc(&#39;Goals&#39;))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() +

    data=oscore,

  geom_beeswarm(
    data=scoring,

  geom_text_repel(
    data=scoring, 
    aes(x=Pos, y=`Goals`, label=Player))+
  labs(
    y = &quot;Goals Scored&quot;,
    title = &quot;WIsconsin falls short in scoring players compared to Ohio State&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;The Badgers lack in scoring defenders but have a wide range of scoring forwards.&quot;,

<p>In the next bar chart, I’m looking specifically at Wisconsin players to see how many points they total. Points includes both goals and assists. I’m looking to see which player for the Badgers is the MVP at the moment for points towards the team. To do this I need to organize my data to show me the top ten players for the amount of points that they’ve totaled.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>top10 &lt;- Badgers %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(Points))%&gt;%
  select(Player, Points)%&gt;%
  top_n(10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Selecting by Points</code></pre>
<p>As you can see from the table below, the player on the Badgers who totals the most points for the team is Makenna Webster. Webster totaled a whopping 33 points so far this season. In the graphic above, you can see that she is the second highest goal scorer on the team at 14 points. This means that she got another 19 points from assists so far this season. I think that it is fair to conclude that at this moment in the season Webster is the MVP for the Badgers after having totaled the most points.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(top10, aes(x = reorder(Player, `Points`), weight = `Points`)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(title = &quot;Top 10 Point Scorers for the Badgers&quot;, 
       x = &quot;Player&quot;, y = &quot;Points&quot;) +              
  theme_light()             </code></pre>
