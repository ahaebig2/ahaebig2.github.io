      <description>For this assignment, I want to look at the Wisconsin Badgers women’s hockey team for this season of 2021-2022. The Wisconsin women are known for being very competitive and a highly ranked national team. Originally I wanted to compare the women’s team to the men’s team at Wisconsin but instead I’m going to look at the women’s team compared to the another top team in their division and the NCAA, Ohio State.</description>

      <description>Are the Nashville Predators going to be able to compete with the rest of the National Hockey League or have they fallen to the bottom of the ranks? The Predators haven’t made much noise since their Stanley Cup final showing in the 2016-2017 season, but with the retirement of goalie Pekka Rinne this summer it brings a new challenge in the net for both their competitors and their own team.</description>

      <description>To begin the assignment, first I must run my library to start using tidyverse. I then must open up my data and give it a name.
